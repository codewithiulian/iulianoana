### Learn to evolve, create to inspire.

Ever since I was a kid, I was always curious about how everything around us came to existence, and more importantly, why? What is the reason behind all of us waking up and creating incredible things for ourselves, like what are we even doing here? Later on, I connected a few dots and concluded that, as human beings, we are born with this innate drive to evolve.

Growing up in Romania taught me to be disciplined and have a strong work and learn ethic. Taught me the best kind of future for yourself is the one that you create. It all started in high school, during an IT for dummies class. I was astonished by the fact that, by writing some lines of code, the computer would output something onto the screen. That was phenomenal. Just so, I graduated high school and moved to England to study Computing at the University of Worcester.

Now I write code for a living and when I don’t I still do. In my profession, my duties are: Developing new features, debugging and fixing existing ones in an Agile manner, and managing SQL databases. As for my ones, alongside all kinds of small projects, I am excited about the mobile development industry, functionality on the go is the way to go.

I’m confident in always being able to learn new technologies, however, my daily specialties are C#, ASP.NET, Web Forms, Angular, Typescript, MVC, WebAPI, SQL, TSQL, VanillaJS, jQuery, CSS, HTML. Tools: Azure DevOps, MS Visual Studio and Visual Studio Code, SSMS, Node.js, OOP, Command Prompt and Windows PowerShell, Visual Studio Team Services (Git), GitHub, GitBash, SQL Server Profiler.
